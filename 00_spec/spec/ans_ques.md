# What is a data set?

- including natural, interger or real number, letters and words made by the alphabet, or specific symbols and properties.

- categored:
    + numberical or non-numberical
    + integer or non-integer
    + random (uniform, Gaussian, Rayleigh) or non-random (almost sorted, somewhat sorted)
    + small, medium and large.

# What is sorting?

# How to sort data?

# The data sorting algorithms can be categorized into two major groups, such as comparison-based and non-comparison-based.

- Comparison-based:
    + Insertion sort
    + Bubble sort
    + Selection sort
    + Merge sort
    + Quick sort
    + Heap sort
    + Shell sort
    + Tim sort
    + Comb sort
    + Cycle sort
    + Cocktail sort
    + Strand sort
    + Binary intertion sort
    + Tree sort
    + Cartesian tree sort
    + Even-odd sort

- Non-camparison-based
    + Radix sort
    + Counting sort
    + Bucket sort
    + Pigeonhole sort
    + Tag sort

- Type of realization: Serial and parallel.
- How do the swaps: In-place and non-in-place.
- Type of algorithm code: Recursive and Non-recursive.
- Application: Specific-application and general-application.
- Sorting class: Comparision-based and non-comparison-based.
- Adaptivity: Adaptive and Non-adaptive.
- Stability: Stable or Non-stable.
